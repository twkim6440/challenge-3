       Here's what each part of the tag means:
       width=device-width: This setting tells the browser to set the width of the viewport to the width of the device's screen. 
       This ensures that the webpage content will adjust to the screen size of the device, making it responsive.
       initial-scale=1.0: This setting specifies the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded. 
       A value of 1.0 means that the page will be displayed at 100% zoom level, without any initial scaling applied.. -->

       <!-- Above tag is to specify the document mode and browser compatibility settings for Internet Explorer.
       In this specific case, the content="ie=edge" value tells Internet Explorer to 
       use the latest rendering engine available, regardless of the version of IE being used. 
       This is often used to ensure that the webpage is displayed correctly and consistently 
       across different versions of Internet Explorer. -->

       <table>   <!-- The <table> element in HTML is used to create a table to display tabular data on a webpage. 
                      It is one of the fundamental elements for structuring and organizing data in a tabular format.
                      When you use the <table> element, you can define rows and columns within the table using additional elements 
                      such as <tr> for table rows, <th> for table headers, and <td> for table data cells.
                      Here are some key points about the <table> element:
                      It serves as the container for the entire table structure.
                      You can include other table-related elements like <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot> within the <table> element 
                      to further organize the table content. By using attributes like border, cellpadding, cellspacing, and width, 
                      you can control the appearance and layout of the table.
                      Overall, the <table> element is essential for creating structured and visually appealing tables 
                      to present data in a clear and organized manner on web pages-->

        <thead>    <!-- The <thead> element in HTML is used to define the header section of a table. 
                        It is typically used to group together the header rows of a table 
                        to differentiate them from the rest of the table content.
                        The <thead> element is often used in conjunction with the <th> element, 
                        which is used to define header cells within a table. 
                        By wrapping header rows with the <thead> element, you can indicate to the browser 
                        that these rows contain header information for the table. -->

          <tr>       <!-- The <tr> element in HTML is used to define a row within a table. 
                          It stands for "table row." 
                          Each <tr> element typically contains one or more table cells (<td> or <th> elements) 
                          that represent the individual cells within that row.
                          By using the <tr> element, you can structure your table data into rows, 
                          making it easier to organize and present tabular information. Each <tr> element creates a new row in the table, 
                          and you can have multiple <tr> elements within a <table> element to represent different rows of data.
                          When you use <tr> elements in conjunction with <td> (table data) or <th> (table header) elements, 
                          you can create structured and organized tables that display data in a clear and readable format.-->

            <th>First Name</th>   <!-- The <th> element in HTML is used to define header cells within a table. It stands for "table header." 
                                       Unlike regular data cells defined with the <td> element, cells defined with <th> are typically used 
                                       to represent header information for a row or column in the table.
                                       The <th> element is commonly used within the <thead> section of a table to define header cells for columns or rows. 
                                       By using <th> elements, you can visually distinguish header cells from regular data cells in a table,
                                       making it easier for users to identify and understand the structure of the table.
                                       When you use <th> elements, browsers typically render the text in bold and center it within the cell by default, 
                                       helping to visually differentiate the header cells from the rest of the table content.-->

                <!-- The <button> element in HTML is used to create a clickable button on a webpage. 
                     It allows users to interact with the webpage by triggering actions or events when clicked.
                     Here are some key points about the <button> element:
                     It can contain text, images, or other HTML elements.
                     It is commonly used for form submission, triggering JavaScript functions, or navigating to another page.
                     You can style <button> elements using CSS to customize their appearance, such as changing colors, fonts, and sizes.
                     The <button> element is often used in conjunction with JavaScript to handle user interactions and perform dynamic actions on the webpage.
                     Overall, the <button> element is a versatile and essential component for creating interactive elements on web pages, 
                     allowing users to engage with the content and perform various actions with a simple click.-->
